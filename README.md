# Configuration files

## VIM (.vimrc)
This file contains a very basic configuration with plugins to make the VIM editor cooler than it already is. If you want to grab it, feel free.

### How to install it
- Copy it to your home folder `~/`..
- Then run the command `vim +PluginInstall +qall`.

If you have any doubts, just go to [the vundle repo](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
